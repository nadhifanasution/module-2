# Managing Python Environments with Conda

With conda, you can create, export, list, remove, and update environments that have different versions of Python and/or packages installed in them. Switching or moving between environments is called activating the environment. You can also share an environment file.

## Let's start on your bash shell (terminal) 
## 1. Create a new environment called 'klasa-env' that contains Python 3.7

`conda create -n klasa-env python=3.7`

Conda checks what additional packages ("dependencies") will be needed, and asks if you want to proceed.

`Proceed ([y]/n)? y`

Type y and press Enter

## 2. Using your environment 

To activate environment (conda 4.6 and later versions)

`conda activate klasa-env`

To list all available environments

`conda info --envs` <br>
The active environment is the one with an asterisk (*).

To deactivate environment

`conda deactivate klasa-env`

## 3. Set up python environment as Jupyter Kernel

Activate the python environment you want to set up jupyter kernel into

`conda activate klasa-env`

Install all dependencies needed to use jupyter

`pip install ipykernel`

Install the kernel for this environment and specify the display name

`python -m ipykernel install --user --name klasa-env --display-name 'KLASA Env'`
